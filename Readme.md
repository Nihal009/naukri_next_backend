# Django API Setup and Running Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up and running the Django API for our project. Follow these steps meticulously to ensure proper configuration and operation of the API on your local environment.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**: Ensure Python version 3.10 or higher is installed. If not, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: Verify Git is installed for cloning the repository. Download Git from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Virtual Environment**: Basic knowledge of virtual environment creation and management is assumed.

## Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository with the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```

   Replace `https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

3. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your_project_directory
   ```

   Replace `your_project_directory` with the name of your cloned project directory.

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   To isolate the project dependencies, create a virtual environment by executing:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   This command generates a virtual environment named `venv`.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **Windows**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   With the virtual environment activated, install the required project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` File**

   In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env` and add the necessary environment variables. Example content includes:

   ```makefile
   DEBUG=True
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   ```

   Ensure you replace `your_secret_key` and `your_database_url` with appropriate values.

## Running Migrations

Execute the following commands to configure the database schema:

1. **Make Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

2. **Apply Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Running the Development Server

Start the Django development server with:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will launch the server and you should see output indicating it is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Testing the API

1. **Access the API**

   Open a web browser or API client (e.g., Postman) and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view the available API endpoints.

2. **Explore Endpoints**

   Use Djangoâ€™s default web interface or API documentation to explore the endpoints.

## Stopping the Server

To halt the Django development server, return to your terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.

## Updating the Project

To synchronize with the latest changes from the repository:

1. **Pull Latest Changes**

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

   Replace `main` with the relevant branch name if different.

2. **Install New Dependencies**

   If new dependencies have been added, install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Apply New Migrations**

   Execute the migration commands if there are new changes:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Network Errors**: Confirm that the virtual environment is activated and dependencies are properly installed.
- **Database Issues**: Verify the `.env` file contains the correct `DATABASE_URL` settings.
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure commands are executed with appropriate permissions or consult system administration.

For further assistance, consult the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/) or seek help from team members.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. Please submit a pull request with your changes and adhere to the project's contribution guidelines outlined in the repository.

Replace `your_username`, `your_repository`, and `your_project_directory` with the appropriate values specific to your setup.
