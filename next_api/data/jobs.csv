**Company Overview:** 





***Are you passionate about making a tangible impact? Do you thrive in a fast-paced environment where attention to detail is key?***
 At Milestone, we're a team of innovative problem-solvers who are revolutionizing mass tort settlement administration. We champion efficiency, transparency, and education for law firms and their clients after settlement.
 



 Milestone is a high-touch settlement services provider that streamlines mass tort settlement administration through innovative technology while providing bespoke attorney fee deferral services and trauma-informed plaintiff settlement planning.
 



 Named a fastest-growing company by both Inc. 5000 and The Business Journals, Milestone drives all growth toward building a better legal system for the plaintiff. We are committed to pushing the boundaries of excellence and innovation in the legal industry.
 








**Characteristics of a Milestonian:** 




 Yes, we have a name for ourselves. We call ourselves Milestonians, and you’ll often hear our “To the moon!” catchphrase shouted in the halls of the office or tacked onto the end of Teams calls. We’re not going to say that we’re a family here (frankly, it’s a little weird when companies say that), but we do consider ourselves to be a tight-knit group, bound by our mutual drive and purpose. As such, Milestonians tend to have the following in common. Milestonians are:
 






* **Dependable.** 
 Milestonians lean into each situation and project with a proactive spirit. We anticipate needs, identify challenges before they arise, and step up collectively when it matters most. Curiosity fuels our dependability, prompting us to ask “why” and “how” at every turn. This spirit of innovation and creativity drives us to dig deeper into the details, articulate issues, seek smarter solutions, and deliver effective results.
* **Empathetic.** 
 Milestonians embrace a people-first approach. Trauma-informed empathy is built into our DNA, making strong interpersonal communication, active listening, and genuine support the cornerstones of every interaction. Milestone celebrates diversity of thought and experience, and Milestonians are empowered to contribute their unique perspective. We care about our clients and seek to understand the nuances of others’ experiences.
* **Agile.** 
 Milestonians find opportunity in the fluidity of our fast-paced, innovative environment. We are able to multi-task and prioritize within the scope of a given project. Challenges spark resourcefulness, prompting us to think critically and strategically, adapt, iterate, and improve. We prioritize flexibility, readily pivoting when needed to ensure the most efficient path to exceeding expectations.
* **Principled.** 
 Milestonians champion open communication, treating each other with respect and understanding. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is encouraged, built on a foundation of trust and accountability. Milestone’s commitment to ethical practices permeates both internal operations, as well as every client interaction.








**Characteristics of a Milestone Quality Engineer:** 




 In addition to the above, we are looking for a candidate who also uniquely fulfills the specific needs of our Quality Engineer role.
 



 We are looking for someone who thrives working with cross-functional teams of engineers, designers, data architects, product managers, and legal and finance professionals. This organized and detail-oriented individual will help maintain a high standard of product quality as we innovate and execute initiatives across Milestone.
 



 Our ideal candidate enjoys proactively diving into the details and doesn’t shy away from a fast-paced, ever-changing workday. This individual embraces problems as opportunities and is able to create high-quality work on quick timelines.
